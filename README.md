# OctoEverywhere Protocol

This repo holds the OctoEverywhere plugin to service protocol, based on flatbuffers. This protocol is the main communication pipeline for all http streams and websockets... it's where the magic happens.

## Support

I'm happy to invite other developers to play with or build off this protocol. However, I don't guarantee any kind of future comparability with services, so use at your own risk. :)

## Why Did You Fork Flatbuffer?

Good question! There were a few good reasons, which I documented here:

## Generate Some Code!

Run:
`.\Gen.cmd`

(sorry that it's a .cmd)
